# Variables and Data Types

Variables are a way for our Python scripts to *store* values, like boxes that hold something in it. For example:

```python
x = 3
```

This makes a variable `x`, which holds value `3`. It's like a box with a label `x` holding the number `3`. But what if I want to hold a name instead?

```python
x = "Bob"
```

In this scenario, we have a name
